This is a simple CRUD project that I'm using to practice Python (SQLAlchemy and FastAPI) and Typescript (React)
<br>Technologies involved: Python, FastApi, SQLAlchemy, React, TypeScript and Tailwind;
<br>The main purpose is: Build a simple system for a Market or any store, allowing the user to Create, edit, Delete or Just Read all the data coming from a database built with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy;
<br>Currently, All the features is working directly using API, via Docs available by FastAPI, but, from Front-end perspective, only reading all the data is working yet, I'm already working on the Create, Update and Delete funcionalities!
<br>The idea is: Build a simple modal to do those features and finish complete this short project.
